[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Linear-Regression-Project)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, Ridge ,Lasso

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**53%** accuracy](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Linear-Regression-Project).

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- We used Ridge and Lasso to increase our model score.

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Breast_Cancer_Classification)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**94%** accuracy using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Breast_Cancer_Classification).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Portu_Bank_Logistic_Regression)

<img src="images/portu_lr.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, SMOTE

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related to direct marketing campaigns of Portuguese banking institution.The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit or not. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not [**88%** accuracy using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Portu_Bank_Logistic_Regression).

- Used logistic regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscription depending on important features.
- Used SMOTE to balance our data.
- Explored a machine learning approach to market analysis.

[Employee Compensation](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Employee_Compensation_KMeans)

<img src="images/EC.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, Elbow, Clustering

**Project Objective:** The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013.This data is summarized and presented on the Employee Compensation.

**Quantifiable result:** I have segregated data in three clusters and scored [**90%** Silhouette Score](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Employee_Compensation_KMeans).

- Used K-means algorythm to create cluster.
- Used elbow method to get the optimal number of cluster.
- Explored an Unsupervised Learning approach to create data group.

[Hand Written Digits Recognition](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Hand-Writting-Recognition-Project)

<img src="images/HD.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** MNIST is a dataset with 70,000 hand written digits. Here I have predicted the hand written digits by using Convolution Neural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**97%** using **10** epochs](https://github.com/Jipsonmv/Hand-Writting-Recognition-Project).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Data Source: MNIST
